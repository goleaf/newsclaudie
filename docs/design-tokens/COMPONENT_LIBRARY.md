# Component Library Documentation (Planned)

This placeholder reserves space for the component library guide inside the design tokens documentation set.

- Document the shared UI components that consume tokens.
- Capture usage examples, props, and accessibility notes.
- Link back to `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` and `DESIGN_TOKENS_USAGE_GUIDE.md` for token definitions.

Move or expand this file when the component library documentation is ready.
