Produce/update tests for the edited code following BlogNews practices.\n\nPROJECT CONTEXT: Laravel 12; Livewire Volt/Flux admin; Tailwind 4; Sanctum; strict types; property testing helpers; Playwright browser tests for critical UX.\n\nEXPECTATIONS:\n- Test behaviors (happy/edge/error), not implementation detail; AAA style with descriptive names.\n- Cover validation, authorization (policies), events/jobs, database state, and URL/query-string persistence where applicable.\n- Use factories and Pest; prefer Feature tests for HTTP/Livewire flows; Unit/property tests for invariants; Playwright for UI regressions (modals, inline edit, filters).\n\nOUTPUT:\n1) Recommended test cases (type + scenario) with brief reasoning.\n2) Example Pest test skeletons/snippets (namespaces/imports included) and any Playwright steps if UI impacted.\n3) Fixtures/factories/data setup needs and cleanup strategy.\n4) Coverage goals and regression risks.\n\nGUARDRAILS: Keep tests fast and isolated; no hardcoded strings (use translations/constants); assert policies/validation; ensure accessibility states (focus/ARIA) for UI flows. Be specific and actionable.\n\ndo it all, do all changes, use mcp, use another sources, do all code changes"
